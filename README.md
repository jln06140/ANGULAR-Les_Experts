## Personal contribution on the Front-end project part

I realize the full front-end apart the following sections :

* modules : weapons/pieceOfEvidence
* tables : weapons/pieceOfEvidence
* api : weapons/pieceOfEvidence


## Known issues

### Process to edit an existing 'affaire' :

* Select an affaire from the 'Tableau de bord' page
* Click on the 'Editer' button to display a form
* Change the values
* Click on 'Envoyer' to save the changes

##### The 'Valider' button doesn't work
##### the 'Annuler' button just hides the form to display back the description of the 'affaire'
##### Hitting the 'Annuler' buton after sending the changes with the 'Envoyer' button doesn't cancel the changes.


### Tables displayed dynamically

The edition / delete of elements from a table isn't effective dynamically and require to refresh the page to be displayed


### Messagerie

Functionnality on the todo list.
The goal is to keep track of interactions on police cases (creation, association, changes).
